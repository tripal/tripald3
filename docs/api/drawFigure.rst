drawFigure
============

This function is a common set-up function meant to ensure that figures are consistent, as well as, to facilitate common options. Furthermore, it should make it easier for developers as they only need to remember the name of a single function.

Specifically, this function adds the necessary markup for a figure containing chart svg, figure legend and key. It also ensures that any pre-existing chart, legend, key are removed prior to drawing of the chart. Furthermore, it calls the specific chart drawing functions.
